Thank you for accepting my connection request. I am currently a Master's student pursuing Computer Engineering at NC State University, graduating in December 2022.

I am interested in putting myself forward for any open full-time SDE roles at NetApp.
My professional experience includes working as an SDE-Intern at Tesla in the Autopilot division and also as Software Engineer at Hero Electronix

If there are any open roles that you think I would be a good fit for, I would be happy to discuss them with you.
I am also attaching my resume for your reference.

Regards
